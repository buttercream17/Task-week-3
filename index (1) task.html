<p>I’ve been waiting to post this recipe for the longest time! This is a long-time favorite recipe and one of my most requested cakes.

The combination of the cotton-soft matcha chiffon cake with light matcha whipped cream is something to die for. Think of a fluffy matcha cloud!</p>

<p>If this recipe seems familiar it is an adaptation of the mango sponge cake that I did earlier. I had so many requests for an 8-inch version so we’re doing an 8-inch version of this cake instead of 6!</p>


<p>Ingredients
Matcha Sponge Cake
Eggs: The eggs are essential to this cake! The yolk gives the cake a rich flavor, while the whites give the cake its fluffiness. This cake relies on the air beat into the meringue to rise rather than rising agents like baking powder.</p>

<p>Milk: Milk gives the cake moisture for a sponge cake that is not too dry. Make sure you use whole milk.</P

<p>Vegetable oil: Oil gives the cake a plush texture while helping to keep it moist. If you don’t have vegetable oil make sure you use any kind of neutral oil.
Cornstarch: A little bit of cornstarch will help the cake have a lighter texture. It plays the same role as cake flour!</p>

<p>All-purpose flour: Flour makes up the structure of the cake, along with the cornstarch.
Matcha powder: Make sure you use high-quality matcha powder for the best flavor and color. I like to use high-quality culinary grade or ceremonial grade matcha! You can increase or decrease the matcha according to your personal preferences.</p>

<p>Matcha Cream
Thickened cream: Also known as heavy cream. If you don’t have any you can also use whipping cream! Make sure you keep it chilled to help it whip up to its full potential.
Granulated sugar: Sugar is used here to sweeten the frosting. You can add more or less depending on your preferred level of sweetness.</p>
<p>Matcha powder: Make sure you sieve your matcha powder before adding it to your cream. Matcha has a tendency to clump up so sieving will prevent your cream from looking grainy.</p>
